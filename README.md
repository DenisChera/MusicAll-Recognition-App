# Description
 
MusicAll Recognizer is an application similar to Shazam, but which brings a series of new features such as:
- Saving song details and lyrics in pdf format
- Customizing the content of the "Details" screen (dark mode or light mode)
- Text-to-speech functionality
- History of recognized songs
- Sorting songs in history alphabetically
  
The application was developed in Android Studio (Java + SQLite) and the ACRCloud and ChartLyrics APIs were used to recognize songs and display lyrics, respectively.
